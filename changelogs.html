        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! This project was started by me, Riley, but I didn't finish this alone. 
            The good folks on the Game Changers League discord server helped immensely with pronouns (How did I forget It/Its?). 
            Additionally, this will eventually be ported to MacOS by @UmuraleFireSeer, so thanks for that!
        </p>
